This is a bash script to specify a repo to clone down and a new name for the local folder.
The repo will be cloned to a tmp folder, stripped of its git history, then moved to where the script was run, and finally tearing down the temp folder that was created.

This script should be put in your $PATH so it can be run globally, as cloneworkshop



-clone or copy just the file cloneworkshop.sh from this repo into  without the .sh (`mv cloneworkshop.sh cloneworkshop`)
-run `chmod +x cloneworkshop` within usr/local/bin
-start a new terminal
-run the command in the desired folder you want the repo cloned.
